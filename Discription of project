# Detection of SSH Brute-Force Attacks on Ubuntu Using Hydra

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the detection of SSH brute-force attacks on an Ubuntu system by analyzing Linux authentication logs generated during a controlled Hydra attack.

## Aim
To analyze SSH brute-force activity using authentication logs on an Ubuntu Linux system.

## Tools & Environment
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: Ubuntu Linux
- Tool Used: Hydra
- SSH Service: OpenSSH
- Logs Analyzed: /var/log/auth.log
- Virtualization: VirtualBox

## Methodology
1. Verified SSH service status on both machines
2. Identified network configuration and IP addresses
3. Monitored authentication logs in real time
4. Performed a controlled SSH brute-force attack using Hydra
5. Analyzed log entries for failed and successful login attempts

## Evidence Observed
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Same source IP address
- Short time intervals between attempts
- Successful password discovery

## Conclusion
Linux authentication logs effectively capture SSH brute-force attempts. Log analysis provides reliable forensic evidence such as timestamps, IP addresses, and authentication failures, making it crucial for incident response and digital forensics.
